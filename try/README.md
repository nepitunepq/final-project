# Computer Engineering Essentials (2110221) (2023/2)

## Final project : POP TA
## Detail
Pop TA is inspired by Pop Cat. It is a fun web game where you can interact with a virtual CEE teaching
assistant! Users will increase points by clicking on the image of the TA. But there's more to it than that. The game
has different functions to keep things interesting and make you have fun.
